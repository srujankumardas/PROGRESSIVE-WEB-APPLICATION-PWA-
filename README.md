DURATION: 4 WEEKS

Task 4: Building a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an E-commerce Platform
As part of my internship at CodTech, I was assigned the task of developing a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an e-commerce platform. This task involved converting a traditional e-commerce website into a modern web app that behaves like a native mobile app with capabilities such as offline access, installability, and a fast, app-like user experience.

 Objectives & My Role
The main objective of this task was to enhance user engagement and performance by integrating PWA features into an existing web project. I was responsible for:

Implementing a service worker to cache site assets

Creating a manifest.json file for installability

Ensuring the app supports offline usage

Creating responsive UI assets like icons and screenshots

Debugging and testing the PWA in different environments

 Tools, Technologies, and Editor Used
I performed this task using the following:

Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

PWA Essentials:

manifest.json: to define app metadata and assets

sw.js: to implement the service worker for caching

Browser Tools:

Chrome DevTools â€“ Application Tab: for verifying manifest, service worker, and offline support

Lighthouse Audits: for testing performance, accessibility, and PWA standards compliance

Image Tools:

Online tools like Squoosh and ResizeImage.net were used to create appropriately sized icons and screenshots (512x512, 192x192, 144x144, etc.)

File Hosting: Local server (Live Server extension in VS Code) to simulate web environment

Key Steps I Performed
Designing the App Manifest (manifest.json)
I created a well-structured manifest file including the following:

App name and short name

Theme and background color

Start URL

Orientation and display mode

Icons in multiple sizes for installability

Screenshots for desktop and mobile preview in the install prompt

Creating a Custom Service Worker (sw.js)
I developed a service worker to:

Cache static resources like HTML, CSS, JS, and image assets

Serve cached assets when offline

Clean up old caches during activation

Fall back to the network when a resource isn't cached

Creating and Optimizing Icons and Screenshots
I designed icons (logo1.png) and exported them into required sizes: 192x192, 512x512, 144x144. I also created two screenshots (540x720 for desktop, 1024x768 for mobile) and validated them using Chromeâ€™s Application tab to meet the form factor specifications.

Testing and Debugging the PWA

Verified manifest and service worker registration

Ensured correct sizes of screenshots to remove warnings

Cleared cache and service worker regularly for fresh tests

Ensured offline access by turning off network and reloading

ðŸ’¼ Real-World Applications
This type of PWA is highly applicable to modern businesses, especially in:

E-commerce: Allowing users to browse and interact with the site even without an internet connection

Retail & Fashion: Offering a native-app-like experience without forcing users to download from an app store

Productivity Tools: Enabling offline mode for users to work without interruptions

News and Media Sites: Allowing users to read saved content offline

Results & Learnings
After completing this task, the e-commerce website is now:

Installable on both mobile and desktop

Capable of functioning offline with cached pages

Optimized for performance using cache-first strategy

Fully compliant with PWA standards

This task significantly enhanced my understanding of PWA architecture, caching mechanisms, and browser APIs. It also sharpened my debugging skills using DevTools and helped me appreciate the power of service workers and the importance of performance optimization in web development.
